# Programming for Everyone
This is my first course!
We'll learn the basics of programming and use our recently acquired knowledge to build an Online Quiz to share with friends and family!

# Project: QuizIt!
We are building an online Quiz you can share with friends and family! Like this one: https://quiz-it-jv.netlify.app/
We'll put in practice everything we have learnt:
- Variables and Data types
- Operators
- Control Flow and Loops
- Arrays
- Objects
- Error handling

## Steps
1. Read `index.html` file and locate where we are linking our Javascript and CSS files
2. Have a quick look into our `styles/main.css` file. That's basic CSS which allows us to change the styles for our websites, such us colors, positions, fonts, and more!
3. To complete this project, you don't need to modify `index.html` or `styles/main.css`, you can focus on the `scripts/main.js` only to add the functionality to your quiz
4. Open `index.html` on any Browser you like (you can use LiveServer to see changes in realtime)
5. Open `scripts/main.js` and follow the instructions. You'll find there is already some code implemented to assist you in this project
6. Code save, and have fun!
