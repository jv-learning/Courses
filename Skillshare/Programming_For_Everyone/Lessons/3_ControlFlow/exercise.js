// create a variable called 'bankAccount' and store 1000 in it

// translate this pseudocode into code:
// if bankAccount is greater or equal than 1500
// then print "Great, you are closer to buy an iPad"
// otherwise print "You still need to save some more"

// translate this pseudocode into code:
// if bankAccount is greater or equal than 1500
// then print "Great, you are closer to buy an iPad"
// if bankAccount is less than 100
// then print "C'mon, you need to save!"
// otherwise print "You still need to save some more" // meaning this is when value is greater than 100 and less than 1500

// create a variable called "favoriteSubject" and store your favorite subject in school
// if favoriteSubject is 'Maths'
// then print "Nice, numbers are the best!"
// if favoriteSubject is 'History'
// then print "Great, let's create a TV Show about it"
// otherwise print `favoriteSubject is cool too`   // where we want to replace favoriteSubject with its value when we print it (string interpolation)
