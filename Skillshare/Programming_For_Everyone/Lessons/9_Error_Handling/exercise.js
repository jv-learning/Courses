// create a function 'add' that accepts two number: a and b
// if both of them are positive numbers
// then return a + b
// otherwise throw an error that says "Both numbers must be positive"

// call the function with two positive numbers and print the result

// call the function with one positive and one negative number and print the result

// use try - catch block to prevent the exception from breaking the program
// when an error occurs, then show a warning message "Error calling add function: ${error.message}"

// add a finally block that informs that the program has finished running
