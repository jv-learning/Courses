// create two variables and assign numbers to them

// print them using all the following operators between them: +, -, *, /, %

// create a constant 'result' with the value of adding the two numbers, then print the constant result
// then, print a more elaborated sentence with the result
// it should look like this: "num1 + num2 is equal to result"

// do the same but using string interpolation
